"""
OLED Controller

This Micropython script acts as an interface for the PiicoDev SSD1306
OLED Display Module.

Main functionality is printing.  Calling print
functions will display text on the OLED Module line by line similar to a
terminal console.

This script is most useful for debugging information when using other
PiicoDev sensors.
