Pico Wi-Fi

This Micropython script acts as either an autonomous program or a
project attachable script to connect a Pico W device to the internet.

Main functionality is reading in a Wi-Fi configuration from config file
and then attempting a connection based on that configuration.  Errors
connecting are detected and appropriate messages displayed to user.

This script is most useful for testing a connection (autonomous) or
establishing a connection for data transfer later (project attachable).
